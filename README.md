### wmset.obj parser


WIP, feel free to contribute sections.

Currently parses:
* Dialog
* Draw points
* Location names
* Object textures
* Object meshes
* Scripts/world map conditions


Exports textures as pngs and meshes as obj/mtl/png to ./output

It looks for a `wmsetus.obj` file in the root, currently
